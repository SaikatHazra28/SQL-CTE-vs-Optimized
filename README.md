# SQL-CTE-vs-Optimized
A detailed version using 10+ CTEs to mimic the original logic.
# 📊 Real-World SQL Reporting Challenge – Dual Approach

This project showcases two different approaches to solving a complex SQL reporting problem inspired by a realistic business scenario.

---

## ✅ Objective

To generate a detailed report using SQL, involving multiple layers of data transformation, aggregation, and business logic.

---

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

### 1. 🧱 CTE-Based Solution

- Breaks down the problem using **10+ Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**.
- Focuses on clarity and step-by-step logical structuring.
- Useful for understanding the full breakdown of the solution.


---

### 2. ⚡ Optimized Solution

- Solves the same problem using **fewer CTEs**.
- Focuses on **performance** and **maintainability**.
- Reduces query length while maintaining the same output logic.
